SYSC 3110 | Software Designing Project

To play the game, run the Game.MonopolyGUIView.java file and follow the follow the graphical user interface, the game in the current state has 4 player by default.

The player will roll 2 dice to determine how many squares he/she will be advancing. If a double is rolled, an extra turn will be granted after the player completes the current turn. If the player rolls 3 doubles in a roll, he/she will be considered as “speeding” and moved to the “jail” Game.Square.

During the player’s turn, the following 6 choices will be always be offered:
(1) Show Stats: displays player's current location, assets and wallet value
(2) Roll Game.Dice: roll a pair and dice and advance according to the rolled value
(3) Buy Property: purchase the property that the player landed on
(4) Sell Property: sell any property that the player has previously purchase to the back for half of the value
(5) Pay Tax/Rent: pay tax if the player landed on a tax square, OR pay rent if the player lands on a private property owned by another player
(3) End Turn: If dice was rolled and all tax/rent were paid off, end turn allows the player to cycle to the next player

Go to Jail:
Players will not be able to select any options as soon as they land on this square, they will be moved to the “Jail” square and their next 2 turns will be suspended for which they can not move or perform any actions.

Income:
Players will be able to earn money in 2 ways:
(1) Players receive a stipend every time they pass the "Go" square
(2) When another player lands on your Property Game.Square, you will receive their rent money based on a percentage of total asset value of the property

Rules regarding Buying/selling properties and rent price:

	- Buy houses, hotel would be fixed percentages of the initial cost of the property
		Houses(Max 4): $100 + 10% of the SQUARE's price
		Hotel(Max 1): $100 + 60% of the SQUARE's price

	Example: the cost of the SQUARE is $2000
		Cost of building a house = $100 + 10% * $2000 = $300
		Cost of upgrading to a hotel = $100 + 60% * $2000 = $1300
	
	- Income is obtained when another player lands on your SQUARE:
	Income is 5% of the total price (SQUARE + houses + hotel)
	Income = 5% * ($2000 + $300 * 4 + $1300) = $225

	- Rails are Special SQURE that when landed on by another player, that player has to pay a percentage
	equavelent to number of the Game.Rail Game.Square the owns by the land owner
	Example: Price of the Game.Rail SQUARE $1000 and the owner owns a total of 3 rail SQUAREs
	Income = 5% * 3 * $1000 = 150

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Bankruptcy happens when a player is unable to pay the rent when landing on another player's SQUARE
	When this happens, the player is forced to sell his assets in half of the price to the bank.
	Example:
	Total assets value = $2000 + $300 * 4 + $1300 = $4500
	Selling value = $4500 / 2 = $2250
	
	In the case that the player does not own any property, the player is out of the game.
